# Anime_Recommendation_Dashboard
A data analysis project made with Python and PowerBI which shows descriptive statistics based on an anime dataset.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project creates descriptive statistics visualizations based on an anime reccomendation dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The project displays relationships between the genre of an anime and its average rating, number of episodes and the number of viewers. It also aggregates the data by the type of anime (TV show, OVA, Movie, etc.). The Pandas library from Python was used to clean the data and preprocess it, creating the respective aggregations based on genre and type. Finally, PowerBI was used to further clean the data in PowerQuery and to create visualizations.

# HOW TO USE
Open `AnimeRecommendationDashBoard.pdf` to view the PDF with all the visualizations.
Open `AnimeRecommendationDashBoard.pbix` in order to view the PowerBI project that was used to create the visualizations.
Open `main.py` to view the Python script that was created to clean and preprocess the data.
`anime.csv` is the input data downloaded from Kaggle. You can view the download link in the `link.txt` file.
`anime_with_dummies.csv`, `AggregationsByType.csv` and `AggregationsByGenre.csv` are preprocessed data created with Python.
